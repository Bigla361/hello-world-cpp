# Hello World in C++
#### A simple program that print "Hello, World!".
Should work on all platforms.
## Usage
To run this program, use the following command:
```bash
hello
```
## Building
Building requires a compiler. These instructions use [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/). It is recommened you use that.
### Linux
To build, run the following command within the directory:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o hello
```
### Windows
To build, run the following command within the directory:
```cmd
g++ main.cpp -o hello.exe
```
Okay, no more documenting a literal Hello World program for me.
